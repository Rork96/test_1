# Pavlo — RN Web Portfolio (v5)

React Native Web single‑file app (no bundler) + local demo pages that work on GitHub Pages.

How to deploy
1) Upload everything in this ZIP to your repo root.
2) Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch → main → /(root). Wait ~1–2 minutes.

Customize
- index.html → config at the top (SOCIALS, FORMSPREE_ID)
- CASES[].demo points to local pages under /demos; you can swap to external URLs later.
- Add phonk.mp3 next to index.html to enable the music toggle.
