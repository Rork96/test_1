# Pavlo â€” Portfolio (v4)

Borrowed your social links and project names from your previous site and placed them in this cleaner single-file React build.

Edit quickly:
- `CASES` array: fill `liveDemo` (iframable) and `repo` for each project.
- Gallery frames: set `<iframe src>` values in the Gallery section or replace with images until you have live demos.
- Contact: replace Formspree `YOUR_FORMSPREE_ID`. Your email/Telegram/Instagram/LinkedIn/Upwork links are already wired.
- Music: drop a file named `phonk.mp3` next to `index.html` to enable the round toggle button.
